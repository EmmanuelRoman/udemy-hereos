# Flash

The Flash (Barry Allen) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Barry Allen is the second character to be known as the Flash. The character first appeared in Showcase #4 (October 1956), created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciler Carmine Infantino.[1] His name combines talk show hosts Barry Gray and Steve Allen.[2] Barry Allen is a reinvention of a previous character called the Flash that had appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Jay Garrick.

His power consists mainly of superhuman speed. Various other effects such as intangibility are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of molecular vibrations. The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring.
